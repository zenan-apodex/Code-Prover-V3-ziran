  Candidate seL4-style optimization task: IRQ pending-bit fold into a dispatch list

  This benchmark models the kernel's interrupt scan loop. The controller keeps a
  per-IRQ pending bit (`pending : Irq → Bool`) over a fixed range `[0, irqBound)`
  together with a per-IRQ mask (`masked : Irq → Bool`). One pass of the fold walks
  the IRQ range in ascending order, and for every IRQ that is BOTH pending and
  unmasked it appends the IRQ number to a batch; this batch is then prepended to
  the existing `dispatch` queue (newest scan first, ascending within the scan).
  Unmasked pendings are cleared (acknowledged) while masked pendings are RETAINED
  so they remain latched until the mask is lifted. The mask map and any pending
  bits at or above the bound are untouched.

  Expected solution style: a single deterministic pass over `List.range irqBound`,
  building the filtered ascending batch and rewriting the pending function.
