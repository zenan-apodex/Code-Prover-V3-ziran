  Candidate seL4-style optimization task: CNode guard compression

  This benchmark models the seL4 capability-space resolution path as a list
  of segments. Each segment carries a guard (a fixed sequence of bits matched
  and skipped during lookup) and a radix (the number of bits consumed by a
  table-indexed step). A "pure guard" segment is one whose radix is zero: it
  contributes only matched guard bits and forces an extra table access without
  consuming any index bits. The optimization fuses each such pure-guard segment
  into its successor, prepending its guard bits, so that one fewer table access
  is performed while the decoded bit sequence is preserved.

  Expected solution style: a single left-to-right fold over the segment list
  that, whenever it sees a zero-radix segment, defers its guard bits and merges
  them into the next segment via `fuse`.
