  Candidate seL4-style optimization task: reply chain compaction

  This benchmark models a kernel reply chain (the linked list of reply objects
  threaded through a call stack) together with a secondary index mapping each
  thread id to its position in the chain. Over time entries get marked
  `cancelled` (the corresponding call was aborted) but remain physically linked.
  The optimization drops every cancelled entry from the chain and rebuilds the
  tid -> position index in a single pass so that lookups remain correct and no
  stale index entries survive.

  Correctness has three teeth. First, the surviving chain must be exactly the
  sublist of live (non-cancelled) entries, in their original order. Second, the
  rebuilt index must map every surviving tid to its NEW position in the
  compacted chain (positions shift down as cancelled entries are removed, so the
  old index is stale and must be recomputed). Third, the index must not retain
  any entry for a tid that no longer appears — dropping a cancelled entry must
  also retract its index slot, otherwise a later lookup would dereference a
  freed reply object.

  The thread ids occurring in the chain are assumed distinct (`h_nodup`); this
  is what makes "the position of tid t" well defined and the index a function.

  Expected solution style: a single traversal that filters out cancelled
  entries and recomputes the position index against the compacted chain.
