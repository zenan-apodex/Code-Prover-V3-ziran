  seL4 Optimization Task: Scheduling Context Refill Merge
  Original: O(n) repeated single-entry refills
  Optimized: O(n) single-pass merge of adjacent refills

  In MCS scheduling, each scheduling context maintains a list of
  "refill" entries — (time, amount) pairs representing when budget
  becomes available. When entries are adjacent or overlapping in time,
  they can be merged to reduce list length. Prove the merge preserves
  total budget and time coverage while eliminating all overlaps.
