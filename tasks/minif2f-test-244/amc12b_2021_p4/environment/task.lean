Ms. Blackwell gives an exam to two classes. The mean of the scores of the students in the morning class is $84$, and the afternoon class’s mean score is $70$. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is $\frac{3}{4}$. What is the mean of the scores of all the students?

$\textbf{(A) }74 \qquad \textbf{(B) }75 \qquad \textbf{(C) }76 \qquad \textbf{(D) }77 \qquad \textbf{(E) }78$
